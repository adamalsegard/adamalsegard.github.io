### My portfolio website
The purpose of this website is to present myself, my coding projects (made in and out of school) and my other commitments. 

It will also serve as a playground for me to try out new techniques and to host different web-based projects.

###### The website was built with:
* Bootstrap
* Angular
* Skrollr

The foundation of this portfolio website is quite outdated now, as it was built in 2015, both in regards to the technologies used and my own knowledge at the time. I have a lot of ideas of how to improve it, but that will be when I feel I have the time for it.
