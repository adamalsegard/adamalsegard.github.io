### My portfolio website
The purpose of this website is to present myself and my work, both my coding projects (made in and out of school) and also my other commitments. 

It will also serve as a playground for me to try out new techniques and hosting different web-based projects.


###### The website is built with:
* Bootstrap
* Angular
* Skrollr

The foundation of this portfolio website is quite outdated by now (Jan 2018) and I have a lot of ideas on how I can improve it. 
For that I'll rebuild it from scratch with React-Redux and Node. However, that'll happen only when I get some more free time. Something I don't have in the nearest future.
