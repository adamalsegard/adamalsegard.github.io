    "description": "Trygga is a service for a safer community. It's essentially a system for a smart panic alarm, but it has a lot of possible areas of development. The basic idea is to have a small device on you, as when triggered sends out a signal to a network of people in the nearby area who can interact if needed. The prototype was built with LittleBits, IFFT and meteor.js. The project was an entry at East Sweden Hack 2015; which is a hackathon at Mjärdevi Science park in Linköping. Trygga won the main price for Best Project. The price itself was a journey to Berlin in late 2015 to meet Start-ups and a couple of Internet-of-things companies (Industry 4.0).",

    "description": "Reverbify is an application where the user can upload, record or choose a default sound that can be 'reverbified'. To 'reverbify' is to add a room's reverb to the chosen sound and then play it as it would sound in that room. This was a short group project in the course Sound Physics (TFYA65). We recorded the impulse response in a couple of rooms with calculations in Matlab. We later used these and some other from the free soundbank Samplicity. The group of three put in a lot of more work than necessary for this type of project. It would have been enough to do the calculations in Matlab but we wanted to build a good application as well.",

    "description": "A simple 3D-landscape for cluster-based Domes created with SGCT and cspice (which in our application calculates the sun's correct position relative coordinates for Norrköping, Sweden). The user can walk around in the landscape and speed up/down time or set a specific time to change the sun's position. The landscape has some mountains and a couple of objects, all with texture. Created as a group project in the course 3D Computer Graphics (TNM061). This was the first time any of us tried SGCT. We implemented lots of stuff during the course of the project that doesn't show in our final version, mostly because we found better ways to do it all the time. There was also a couple of thing we didn't really get a hang of. Shadow mapping for example, which I worked a lot on but didn't quite get correct up til deadline. You need to cmake the project before you can compile it, and it will look rather bad if you don't run it in a cluster. But you can look at https://c-student.itn.liu.se/wiki/develop:sgcttutorials:compile if you want to compile our source code.",

A sci-fi short film done with a couple of classmates in the course Digital Media (TNM088). Big thanks to all actors and extras who contributed without payment. The film was produced during a couple of weeks in the autumn of 2013. I was the director, editor, writer, casting- and ADR-director. I also did a promotional website prior to our deadline. After our first showing my cinematographer Benjamin Wiberg did a new website. both can be seen to the right.",
